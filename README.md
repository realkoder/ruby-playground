# Ruby Basics ‚ô¶Ô∏è

This is my approach into _Ruby_ - here I will provide links, configs, codepieces and other miscellaneous related to geting into _Ruby_ programming.

## Ruby installation

[On mac Ruby is default installed but want to have it controlled with Homebrew rbenv](https://danielmarklund.com/brew-rbenv-bundle-explained)

Installation commands for `rbenv`:

```bash
brew install ruby-build

brew install rbenv

# Ensure that ruby is pointing to brew configured ruby
# else configure ~/.zshrc file and add: export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
which ruby
/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/ruby

rbenv init

# Ensuce correct installation
rbenv -v
```

Installation commands for `ruby`:

```bash
brew upgrade ruby-build

# Recommened version by Odin project
rbenv install 3.4.2 --verbose

# Set global ruby version
rbenv global 3.4.2

# Ensure it's correctly changed
ruby -v
```

Using _Ruby LSP shopify_ extension for VSC.

## Ruby Gem

`A "gem" in Ruby is a self-contained package of a library or Ruby program. We can use Ruby's gem command to install the latest version of Rails and its dependencies from RubyGems.org.`

#### Gem installation issues

After installing various packages with _gem_, I encountered issues accessing them. I discovered that I needed to add the path to the directory where the _gems_ were installed in my `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Run this to figure out where a given gem installation is stored
gem list -d <gemname>

# Add this path to ~/.zshrc
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin:$PATH"

# After changes made to ~/.zshrc run to update paths etc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### Project configuring

Add a `Gemfile` and excute `bundle install`

add following to `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "ruby-lsp"
gem "rubocop"
```

## Simple Ruby excecution üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Activate the _(REPL)_ / _Interactive Ruby (IRB)_ in terminal type: `irb` or run a ruby file by `ruby <ruby-file>.rb`

## Setting up Rails

Following is how _Rails_ was configured and installed.

```bash
gem install rails

# Ensure its installed by checking version
rails --version
```

_Excellent, now \_Rails_ is installed - create a new _Rails app_:\_

```bash
rails new store
```

<br>

_Ensure app is created correctly with the multiple preconfigured folders - if so start app:_

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Generate a controller:

```bash
rails generate controller Home index
```

[Intro to Rails and folder structure explained](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

If issues with extension Run `bundle install` standing in the created _Rails app_ to install all the required gems specified in the Gemfile.

### Rails Migtation/Active Record

Commands to create a migration with simple table and related Active Record model and activate / rollback the migraiton.

```bash
# Create a simple products table with related Product model
bin/rails generate model Product name:string

# Running the migration
bin/rails db:migrate

# Rollback latest migration
bin/rails db:rollback
```

#### Rails ActiveRecord Callbacks (Cheat Sheet)

**Callbacks** are hooks that let you run code at certain points in an object's lifecycle.

**Common Callbacks**

| Callback         | When it Runs                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `before_save`    | Before saving (create/update) |
| `after_save`     | After saving (create/update)  |
| `before_create`  | Before creating a new record  |
| `after_create`   | After creating a new record   |
| `before_update`  | Before updating a record      |
| `after_update`   | After updating a record       |
| `before_destroy` | Before destroying a record    |
| `after_destroy`  | After destroying a record     |

**Simple examples**

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  before_destroy :log_before
  after_destroy :log_after

  private

  def log_before
    puts "About to destroy product #{id}"
  end

  def log_after
    puts "Destroyed product #{id}"
  end
end
```

---

#### Validations

_Active Record_ provides _validations_ to ensure that data added adheres to defined rules.

Add a `presence validation` to the _Product model_ to ensure that all _products_ must have a `name`.

```ruby
class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end
```

Test the _presense validation_ in _Rails Console_

```bash
# Reload console if running while adding the validation
reload!

# Check that validation works
product = Product.new

# Save the instantiated Product where name is nil
product.save
=> false

# Get the validation error
product.errors
=> #<ActiveModel::Errors [#<ActiveModel::Error attribute=name, type=blank, options={}>]>

# Generate a friendly error message
product.errors.full_messages
=> ["Name can't be blank"]
```

---

### Rails console

The _Ruby on Rails console_ is used to interact with _ActiveRecords_, following commands will show **creating, querying, sorting, filtering** etc.

Default _Ruby on Rails console_ uses the _development_ env.

```bash
# Activate Rails console - enters in dev evn else usse bin/rails console test
bin/rails console

# Update the console if code changes such as an added presence validation
reload!

# Get column names for created Product
Product.column_names
=> ["id", "name", "created_at", "updated_at"]

# Create a new Product - id is nil since it's not persisted in DB
product = Product.new(name: "T-Shirt")
=> #<Product:0x000000012fd524f8 id: nil, name: "T-Shirt", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>

# Write to DB
product.save
  TRANSACTION (0.4ms)  BEGIN immediate TRANSACTION /*application='Store'*/
  Product Create (9.9ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("name", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ('T-Shirt', '2025-05-24 16:52:45.450023', '2025-05-24 16:52:45.450023') RETURNING "id" /*application='Store'*/
  TRANSACTION (0.7ms)  COMMIT TRANSACTION /*application='Store'*/
=> true

# Instead of using .new -> .create can be used to instantiate and persist Product in a single call
product = Product.create(name: "Crewneck")
  TRANSACTION (0.2ms)  BEGIN immediate TRANSACTION /*application='Store'*/
  Product Create (2.7ms)  INSERT INTO "products" ("name", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES ('Crewneck', '2025-05-24 16:54:44.025091', '2025-05-24 16:54:44.025091') RETURNING "id" /*application='Store'*/
  TRANSACTION (0.7ms)  COMMIT TRANSACTION /*application='Store'*/
=> #<Product:0x000000013eb27318 id: 2, name: "Crewneck", created_at: "2025-05-24 16:54:44.025091000 +0000", updated_at: "2025-05-24 16:54:44.025091000 +0000">

# Query records using Rails console
Product.all
Product.all
  Product Load (3.2ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products" /* loading for pp */ LIMIT 11 /*application='Store'*/
=>
[#<Product:0x000000013eb20798 id: 1, name: "T-Shirt", created_at: "2025-05-24 16:52:45.450023000 +0000", updated_at: "2025-05-24 16:52:45.450023000 +0000">,
 #<Product:0x000000013eb20658 id: 2, name: "Crewneck", created_at: "2025-05-24 16:54:44.025091000 +0000", updated_at: "2025-05-24 16:54:44.025091000 +0000">]

# Query by searching for a specific column value
Product.where(name: "Crewneck")

# Sort by a given column either asc or desc
Product.order(name: asc)

# Get amount of total records
Product.count

# Lookup a record by ID
Product.find(1)

# Update a record by .update
product = Product.find(1)
product.update(name: "Hoodie")

# Update a record by .save
product = Product.find(1)
product.name = "T-Shirt"
product.save

# Delete a record
product = Product.find(1)
product.destroy

```

#### `destroy` vs `delete`

- `destroy`: **Runs callbacks** (and dependent destroys)
- `delete`: **Skips callbacks** (deletes directly from DB)

```ruby
product.destroy # Runs callbacks
product.delete  # Skips callbacks
```
