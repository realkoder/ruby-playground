# Ruby Basics ‚ô¶Ô∏è

This is my approach into _Ruby_ - here I will provide links, configs, codepieces and other miscellaneous related to geting into _Ruby_ programming.

## Ruby installation

[On mac Ruby is default installed but want to have it controlled with Homebrew rbenv](https://danielmarklund.com/brew-rbenv-bundle-explained)

Installation commands for `rbenv`:

```bash
brew install ruby-build

brew install rbenv

# Ensure that ruby is pointing to brew configured ruby
# else configure ~/.zshrc file and add: export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
which ruby
/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin/ruby

rbenv init

# Ensuce correct installation
rbenv -v
```

Installation commands for `ruby`:

```bash
brew upgrade ruby-build

# Recommened version by Odin project
rbenv install 3.4.2 --verbose

# Set global ruby version
rbenv global 3.4.2

# Ensure it's correctly changed
ruby -v
```

Using _Ruby LSP shopify_ extension for VSC.

## Ruby Gem

`A "gem" in Ruby is a self-contained package of a library or Ruby program. We can use Ruby's gem command to install the latest version of Rails and its dependencies from RubyGems.org.`

#### Gem installation issues

After installing various packages with _gem_, I encountered issues accessing them. I discovered that I needed to add the path to the directory where the _gems_ were installed in my `~/.zshrc` file:

```bash
# Run this to figure out where a given gem installation is stored
gem list -d <gemname>

# Add this path to ~/.zshrc
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.4.0/bin:$PATH"

# After changes made to ~/.zshrc run to update paths etc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Project configuring

Add a `Gemfile` and excute `bundle install`

add following to `Gemfile`:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "ruby-lsp"
gem "rubocop"
```

## Simple Ruby excecution üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Activate the _(REPL)_ / _Interactive Ruby (IRB)_ in terminal type: `irb` or run a ruby file by `ruby <ruby-file>.rb`

## Setting up Rails

Following is how _Rails_ was configured and installed.

```bash
gem install rails

# Ensure its installed by checking version
rails --version
```

_Excellent, now \_Rails_ is installed - create a new _Rails app_:\_

```bash
rails new store
```

<br>

_Ensure app is created correctly with the multiple preconfigured folders - if so start app:_

```bash
bin/rails server
```

Generate a controller:
```bash
rails generate controller Home index
```

If issues with extension Run `bundle install` standing in the created _Rails app_ to install all the required gems specified in the Gemfile.
